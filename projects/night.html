    							<h2>​SCENARIO ONE</h2>
    							<p>
    								​Sophia is a 20-year-old college student, living in a dormitory with 3 other girls. She likes to smile and has been very kind to others. But recently she has some problem with her roommates. She sets her alarm at 7:00 AM every morning for her math class. But as Sophia being a super-heavy sleeper, it takes quite a while for the alarm to fully wake her up, during which all her three roommates have been awaken by the noise. They are mad at Sophia and start to isolate her. “But it’s not my fault”, said Sophia sadly.
    							</p>
    							<h2>​SCENARIO TWO</h2>
    							<p>
    								​Jack is a 27-year-old UX Designer working at Facebook. He got married with his loving wife three months ago. But recently this couple have some serious relationship issues. Every night Jack snores so loudly that his wife just cannot fall into sleep. She tried to push Jack when he snores, but it only works for a few minutes before he snores again. His wife, a high school teacher, suffers a lot from this and it affects her daytime job. Finally, she can’t stand it anymore and wants to divorce. Jack doesn’t know what to do.
    							</p>

							<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
							<h3>Q: What are the key functions of NightyKnight?</h3>
							<p>
								We have 3 key functions: <br>
						1. Wakes you up without making any sound <br>
						2. Stops snoring without waking you up <br>
						3. Provides health-related services in the mobile app
							</p>
							<h3>Q: How does NightyKnight wake me up?</h3>
							<p>
									First you need to set the time for you to get up in the mobile app, for example 7:00 AM. Then during 6:45 to 7:00, the NightyKnight pillow will sense where you are in your sleep cycle based on your movements, and wake you up at the best moment. It will use gentle vibrations to wake you and it won’t affect others.
							</p>
							<h3>Q: How does NightyKnight sense snoring?</h3>
							<p>
								The pillow is equipped with build-in sonic sensor that can detect snoring. You can set the sensitivity of it in the mobile app.
							</p>
							<h3>Q: How does NightyKnight stop snoring?</h3>
							<p>
								​As shown in the picture on the right, the pillow consists of three sections: A, B and C. The B part has an air-chamber in it and that’s where magic happens. When the sonic sensor detects snoring, the air-chamber inside B section will inflate gently. This will encourage you to change position and sleep on your side, not on your back. Turning the head to the side increases the gap between the tongue and throat, which will help reduce blockage of airways so that breathing is easier and quiet. The air-chamber will remain inflated for a while to hold the head in position to prevent from snoring again.
							</p>

							<h3>Q: What can the mobile APP do?</h3>
							<p>
								You can download the NightyKnight mobile APP in your appstore for free. After receiving the pillow, you can connect the app to your pillow via Bluetooth. In the app you can customize your pillow to your preference, for example, by setting the time to wake up, changing the sensitivity of the snore sensor, etc. <br>
								Another function of the app is to collect your sleeping data. With your permission, the app will collect data like heart rate, breathing rate, how much you’re tossing around, even the sound of your snoring. With these information, we can evaluate your sleeping quality and provide personalized health-related services.
